This project offers a regression-based approach over fully explainable fuzzy rules (Mamdani FIS) to discover biases in arbitrary datasets.

More details (especially technical documentation) will follow in the next months.

# Overview

Fuzzy-Regression XAI is a regression-based approach utilizing fully explainable fuzzy rules (Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System) to discover and analyze biases in arbitrary datasets with a **numeric target variable**. This tool leverages fuzzy inference systems to create simple basis functions. One such basis function could mean `If NumberOfRooms is high AND If District is downtown then Price is veryhigh`, which would automatically be generated by the tool and assigned a coefficient to show, how important this rule is in the regression system.

# Notes

It is recommended to remove outliers, especially on the target variable (can be performed by using `outlier_filtering`)! This is important, since the fuzzy sets (veryhigh, high, ...) are spread with equal size.

# Installation
## Prerequisites
- Suggested Node.js version: `22.11.0`
- npm (Node Package Manager) v6.0 or higher

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Usage
One can either choose to serve this project in an API or to compile it and import it in the browser.

First, clone the repo and get the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/S0urC10ud/xai-fuzzy-regrules
cd xai-fuzzy-regrules
npm i
npm run build:(web or node)
```

### Running as API Server
Start the server:
```
npm run build:node
npm start
```

Furthermore, the following debugging configuration can be used with VS-Code:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
        "type": "node",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch TypeScript (Dev)",
        "runtimeExecutable": "node",
        "runtimeArgs": ["--inspect"],
        "args": ["-r", "ts-node/register", "src/api/index.ts"],
        "sourceMaps": true,
        "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"],
        "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"]
        },
        {
        "type": "node",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch JavaScript (Prod)",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/api/index.js",
        "runtimeArgs": ["--inspect"],
        "sourceMaps": true,
        "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
        "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Running the Browser Frontend
The UI currently WIP.

To run the frontend first bundle it:
```
npm run build:web
```

And then serve it with the web-server of your choice (e.g. `http-server`) in the root-directory of this project.

# API Documentation

## POST /api/upload
Uploads a CSV file along with metadata to process the data and generate regression models.
Request:

Headers:
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
- csvFile: The CSV file to be uploaded.
- metadata: JSON string containing configuration parameters.

Warning: If you use regularization, the t-Test results (pValue) cannot be considered entirely correct!

Example request metadata:
```json

    }

  "remove_low_variance": false, // Defaults to false, toggles only warn vs. actually remove columns below variance threshold
