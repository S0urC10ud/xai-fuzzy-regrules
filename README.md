This project offers a regression-based approach over fully explainable fuzzy rules (Mamdani FIS) to discover biases in arbitrary datasets.

Currently work in progress. More details (especially technical documentation) will follow in the next months.

# Overview

Fuzzy-Regression XAI is a regression-based approach utilizing fully explainable fuzzy rules (Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System) to discover and analyze biases in arbitrary datasets with a **numeric target variable**. This tool leverages fuzzy inference systems to create simple basis functions. One such basis function could mean `If NumberOfRooms is high AND If District is downtown then Price is veryhigh`, which would automatically be generated by the tool and assigned a coefficient to show, how important this rule is in the regression system.

# Installation
## Prerequisites
- Node.js v14.0 or higher
- npm (Node Package Manager) v6.0 or higher

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Usage
One can either choose to serve this project in an API or to compile it and import it in the browser.

### Running as API Server
Build the project:
```
npm run build
```

Start the server:
```
npm start
```

Furthermore, the following debugging configuration can be used with VS-Code:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
        "type": "node",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch TypeScript (Dev)",
        "runtimeExecutable": "node",
        "runtimeArgs": ["--inspect"],
        "args": ["-r", "ts-node/register", "src/api/index.ts"],
        "sourceMaps": true,
        "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"],
        "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"]
        },
        {
        "type": "node",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch JavaScript (Prod)",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/api/index.js",
        "runtimeArgs": ["--inspect"],
        "sourceMaps": true,
        "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
        "outFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/dist/**/*.js"]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Running the Browser Frontend
The UI currently WIP.

To run the frontend first bundle it:
```
npm run webpack
```

And then serve it with the same webserver:
```
npm start
```

# API Documentation

## POST /api/upload
Uploads a CSV file along with metadata to process the data and generate regression models.
Request:

Headers:
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Body:
- csvFile: The CSV file to be uploaded.
- metadata: JSON string containing configuration parameters.

Example request metadata:
```json
{
  "split_char": ";", // split character for the CSV-file
  "target_var": "MEDV", // target column from csv file to explain
  "regularization": 0.001, // to avoid a singular matrix for inversion (equiv. to regularization)
  "l1_row_threshold": 0.1, // row/(2*threshold) will be serialized to a string and checked for duplicates
  "l1_column_threshold": 0.1, // same as l1_row_threshold but column-wise 
  "numerical_fuzzification": ["low", "medium", "high"], // defines the fuzzy sets - possible values to be chosen: verylow, low, mediumlow, medium, mediumhigh, high, veryhigh
  "numerical_defuzzification": ["verylow", "medium", "veryhigh"], // same as above
  "variance_threshold": 1e-5, // Columns with a variance smaller than this value can be removed, set to 0 to disable
  "outlier_filtering": {
    "AGE": { // column name
      "method": "VariableBounds",

      "method": "IQR",
      "outlier_iqr_multiplier": 4
    }
  },
  "num_vars": 2, // number of antecedents to combine - will scale compute quadratically
  "whitelist": [ // these rules will definitely be included
    "If CRIM is high AND If PTRATIO is high then MEDV is verylow",
    "If DIS is low AND If INDUS is high then MEDV is verylow",
  ],
  "blacklist": [ // these rules will be removed from the generation
    "If CRIM is high AND If RM is high then MEDV is verylow",
    "If DIS is high AND If LSTAT is high then MEDV is veryhigh"
  ],
  "only_whitelist": false, // disables the rule generation and forces the system only to use the specified whitelist-rules
  "dependency_threshold": 1, // if the diagonal of the Cholesky-Decomposition for this rule is less than this value, we assume it can be explained by other rules (linear combination) 
  "significance_level": 0.05, // for the t-test with H0 that the coefficient Beta=0
  "remove_insignificant_rules": false,
  "rule_priority_weights": { // weigthing for ordering the rules - the order is important for the linear dependency threshold removal; rule.priority =   
    "support_weight": 2, // support_weight * rule.support (see association rule mining theory) +
    "leverage_weight": 10, //  leverage_weight * rule.leverage (see association rule mining theory) +
